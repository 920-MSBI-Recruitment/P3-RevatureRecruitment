# Revature Recruitment Startup

## Getting Started
There are several components of this project that need to be setup in order to continue working on it. These components include running the SSIS packages to instantiate the 
Relational Database and Data Warehouse, properly deploying the several Tabular Analysis models to an Analysis Service, and publishing the various SSRS and Power Bi reports to
the Power Bi Web Service. Following this startup file will allow anyone who continues this project in the future a good starting point.
